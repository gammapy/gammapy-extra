    "# Gammapy tutorial notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is this?\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is an overview of tutorial [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks for [Gammapy](http://gammapy.org), a Python package for gamma-ray astronomy.\n",
    "* The notebooks complement the Gammapy Sphinx-based documentation at http://docs.gammapy.org\n",
    "* You can read a static HTML version of these notebooks (i.e. code can't be executed) online [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gammapy/gammapy-extra/tree/master/notebooks/).\n",
    "* The notebooks and example datasets are available at https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-extra\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to execute the notebooks locally, to play around with the examples, or to try to do one of the exercises, you have to first install Gammapy and get the `gammapy-extra` repository. This is described in [Gammapy tutorial setup](notebooks/tutorial_setup.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Gammapy is a Python package built on Numpy and Astropy, and the tutorials are Jupyter notebooks. If you're already familar with those, you can skip to the next section and start learning about Gammapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to Python or scientific Python, we can recommmend the following resources:\n",
