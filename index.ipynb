    "\n",
    "This directory contains [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) (a.k.a. [IPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) until recently) that show examples what can be done with [Gammapy](http://gammapy.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "This complements the [Gammapy Sphinx-based documentation](https://docs.gammapy.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "* A [static HTML version of these notebooks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gammapy/gammapy-extra/tree/master/notebooks/) (i.e. code can't be executed) is available via the online [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try an executable version at [Gammapy binder](http://mybinder.org/repo/gammapy/gammapy-extra).\n",
    "Clicking that link will start a Docker image on some cloud server, which usually takes about 30 seconds.\n",
    "How this works is described in a little more detail [here](http://docs.gammapy.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#binder).\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to try out Gammapy quickly you should install IPython and Gammapy and then get the [gammapy-extra](https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-extra) repo (either via git or as a zip file) and then go to the `notebooks` folder in a terminal and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "      $ jupyter notebook\n",
