Changes from v15 to v17 of the extended sources archive:
--------------------------------------------------------

- Added Name_3FGL column and changed 1FGL_Name and 2FGL_Name to Name_1FGL 
  and Name_2FGL respectively to eliminate leading numerics.

- Reduced column sizes for Model_Form, Spatial_Function, Spatial_Filename, 
  Spectral_Function, and Spectral_Filename columns.

- Changed formatting for Photon_Flux, Energy_Flux, Model_SemiMajor, 
  Model_SemiMinor, and Model_PosAng columns.
  
- Removed rogue white spaces in names of XML and FITS files for HESS J1303-631 
  and HESS J1841-055.

- Updated RX J1713-3945 template to correct projection. New FITS spatial map is 
  called "RXJ1713-3945_v2.fits"

- Used more pixels for W 51C template

- Reset all geometric templates to RA---ARC (IC 443, HESS J1825-137, MSH 15-52,
  HESS J1616-508, HESS J1837-069, HESS J1632-478, Puppis A, W 30, W 51C, W 28,
  HESS J1614-518, gamma Cygni, Cygnus Cocoon, Vela X)

- Previous XML templates: bounds on normalization parameter set to [0,100]
  PowerLaw2 replaced by PowerLaw with pivot energy and flux density from 3FGL. 
  Changed Spectral_Function from PowerLaw2 to PowerLaw for: S 147, Vela X, 
  Vela Jr., HESS J1303-631, Cen A Lobes, MSH 15-52, HESS J1614-518, 
  HESS J1616-508, HESS J1632-478, RX J1713, HESS J1837-069, HESS J1841-055, 
  gamma Cygni, and Cygnus Cocoon.
  
- Adjusted associations to account for new sources and multiple LMC 
  components: 
  - Added 1FGL associations to: HB 3, W 3, LMC-FarWest, LMC-Galaxy, 
    LMC-30DorWest, LMC-North, MSH 15-56
  - Added 2FGL associations to: HB 3, W 3, Fornax A, HB 9, LMC-FarWest,
    LMC-Galaxy, LMC-North, HESS J1841-055
  
  
New sources added:

- HB 9 uses the 5 GHz radio template. Spectral model is LogParabola.

- Large Magellanic Cloud emissivity templates: four components, three small 
  components described as power laws plus main LMC component described as 
  LogParabola. Provides a major improvement with respect to previous LMC 
  models.

- MSH 15-56, G296.5+10.0 from the SNR catalog. Spatial models
  are disks, spectral models are power laws.

- HB 3 disk template, with LogParabola spectral model. 

- W 3 uses a CO template. Spectral model is LogParabola.

- RCW 86 (SNR G315.4-2.3) uses the HESS spatial template. Spectral model 
  is a power law.

- Small Magellanic Cloud uses the emissivity template and a PLExpCutoff 
  spectrum.

- Fornax A uses the radio template, rebinned 4x4. Spectral model is a 
  power law.
