gammapy-extra
=============

The main `gammapy` repository is located at
https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy
and contains the code and Sphinx docs.

The `gammapy-extra` repository is located at
https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-extra
and contains everything that is considered too large
in terms of filesize to be part of the main repo.

Currently we have the following folders:

* `datasets` |---| Gammapy example datasets
* `notebooks` |---| Gammapy IPython notebooks
* `logo` |---| Gammapy logo and banner

A static, rendered version of the notebooks is available online at
