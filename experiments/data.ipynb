    "# IACT DL3 data handling in Gammapy\n",
    "\n",
    "The current IACT DL3 data handling and all analyses in Gammapy have some issues and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No support for 1D or 3D analysis in time intervals, only full runs\n",
    "- No support for event types\n",
    "- Poor support for pulsar PHASE selection (only for 1D, in background estimator)\n",
    "- No support for user-defined events selections (e.g. MC_ID)\n",
    "- Creating data selection (e.g. Crab) and making a copy is cumbersome (need to write code to make new index files)\n",
    "- One observation class that's a proxy to on-disk data, another for completely in-memory. Mix not supported (e.g. simulate events).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do 1D or 3D analysis for part of a run (say 1 minute)\n",
    "- Do 1D or 3D analysis for multiple runs (say 1 night or week)\n",
    "- Make GPS survey maps for CTA (process 10 GB of events data and 3000 runs)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What others have\n",
    "\n",
    "With Fermi-LAT, you always have gtselect and gtmktime at the start:\n",
    "https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/scitools/data_preparation.html\n",
    "Later tools (bin, fit) partly rely on \"data sub space\" DSS header keys for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ctools, every analysis starts with an \"observation definition file\" and also by running ctselect\n",

    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "The new scheme we propose is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The central class is `Observations`, that's the object passed to analysis classes like `MapMaker` or `SpectrumExtraction`.\n",
    "- `Observations` holds a list of `Observation` objects\n",
    "- `Observation` is a proxy object that uses a \"store\" object to access the data (events, irfs, ...)\n",
    "- The \"store\" object can either be a `DataStore`, `XMLStore` or `ObservationStore` object. The first two hold the data on disk, the last in memory. All these \"store\" objects should have a similar API.\n",
    "- This scheme is already followed by the `DataStoreObservation`/`DataStore` objects, with small changes we should be able to generlize this. So the new `Observation` object will be very similar to the current `DataStoreObservation`.\n",
    "- The `Observation` class holds filters that are applied on-the-fly when the data is accessed\n",
    "- The filtering is done by a dedicated class (`ObservationFilter`) which will be a data member of a the `Observation` class\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding GTI handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sum over gtis will provide the on time for the observation\n",
    "- This means a time filter on the GTIs will automatically modify the on time as wanted \n",
    "\n",
    "(- We leave the current `DataStore`, `HDUIndexTable` and `ObservationTable` classes alone,\n",
    "  they are one way to serialise observation definition information that we still support,\n",
    "  but moving forward we will develop something better (YAML).)\n",
    "\n",
    "See also this proposal:\n",
    "https://gist.github.com/registerrier/010d023e97aaa87b851c15bf736408ad\n",
